CS 559 - PROJECT 2 - FEATURE LIST
=================================

1] by bob wagner (cs login: bob | id: 906-424-8603)

2] For this project, I *completely* scrapped the graphics town idea and made an entirely different universe! I present:
	
	<=== Abyssal Dream Island ==> Strange energies command the environment here; venture at your own risk!

3/4]

+ multiple objects moving at any time:
	- particles
	- Mysterious Sphere 1
	- etc.
+ multiple behaviors:
	- Float
	- Orbit
	- etc.
+ multiple types of buildings / scenery
	- volcano height map model
	- mountains
	- island
	- fire trees
	- etc.
+ multiple new textures:
	- volcano skin (non-flat)
	- island rock skin (non-flat)
	- mountains skin (non-flat)
	- lava
	- skybox
	- etc.
+ shader pairs:
	- lavaShader -> in volcano -> (procedural texture) -> real clk/time
	- lightShader -> Mysterious Ball -> (affected by lighting)
	- groundShader -> open doors (early morning will be black, (late at night is red) -> (affected by time of day) -> timeOfDay
+ affected by time of day
	- doors to volcano open at night
+ "advanced" texture mapping:
	- skybox that properly moves with camera location (always stays in center)
+ curved surface object(s):
	- goblet wireframe (surface of revolution)

+ techincal challenges:
/*
*	Four levels of succeeding at a technical challenge:
*		1 - You thought about doing it and got started.
*		2 - You got it implemented, and almost working. It’s probably close.
*		3 - It works, and you can show that it works on simple examples.
*		4 - You use it for something cool.
*/
	- skybox that properly moves with camera location (always stays in center)
	- surface of revolution (goblets)
	- particle engine (magical dust coming out of goblets)
	- height map (volcanodw)
	- external model loader
		> spent a significant amount of time trying to get external model loader to work, 
		  was able to parse .OBJ files into their respective verticies, normals, faces, etc.
		  but was unable to acutally load them into the world
		> I'm thinking this part would receive a 2/4 on the scale above.
	- others I may have missed	
	- Extra Feature: Wireframe Mode

5] The particle engine in conjunction with the wire-frame goblets were one of my favorite additions to the project.
